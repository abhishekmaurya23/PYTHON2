    "The `while` loop in Python is used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true. It allows you to create loops where the number of iterations is not known beforehand or where the loop should continue until a certain condition is met. The `while` loop is useful when you want to repeat a block of code until a specific condition becomes false.\n",

    "    # Code block\n",
    "    # (executed as long as the condition is true)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `condition` is an expression that is evaluated before each iteration. If the condition is true, the code block inside the loop is executed. After the code block is executed, the condition is evaluated again. If the condition remains true, the loop continues to execute, and this process repeats until the condition becomes false.\n",

    "print(\"Loop finished\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `while` loop executes as long as the `count` variable is less than 5. Inside the loop, the current value of `count` is printed, and then `count` is incremented by 1 using `count += 1`. This process repeats until `count` becomes 5.\n",

    "Count: 1\n",
    "Count: 2\n",
    "Count: 3\n",
    "Count: 4\n",
    "Loop finished\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `while` loop is especially useful in scenarios where the number of iterations is not predetermined, or when you want to repeatedly execute a block of code until a certain condition is met. However, it is important to ensure that the condition inside the `while` loop will eventually become false; otherwise, the loop will continue indefinitely, resulting in an infinite loop."
